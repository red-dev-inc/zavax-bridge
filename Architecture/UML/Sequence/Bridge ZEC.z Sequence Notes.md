## Bridge ZEC.z to ZEC Sequence Diagram Notes
### ZEC.z to ZEC Bridging States
As each bridging transaction progresses, it passes through five distinct *bridging states* (0-4) with (a) variations on success or (b) variations on failure. It is important to consider which state a transaction is in during failure recovery.

<b>State 0</b>
- Nothing bridged

<b>State 1</b>
- ZEC.z is in escrow
- ZEC unwrap warp message ready for pickup

<b>State 2</b>
- ZEC.z is in escrow
- ZEC tx is ready for signature assembly and submission

<b>State 3a</b>
- ZEC.z is in escrow
- ZEC has been unwrapped

<b>State 3b</b>
- ZEC.z is in escrow
- ZEC has not been unwrapped

<b>State 4a</b>
- ZEC.z has been burnt
- ZEC has been unwrapped
- Bridging is complete 

<b>State 4b</b>
- ZEC.z has been returned
- ZEC has not been unwrapped
- Bridging failed and original balances of ZEC and ZEC.z have been restored

### Failure Recovery

For simplicity and clarity, the sequence diagram does not show what happens in case of comm or system failures of components. The following table (presented in lieu of activity diagrams) describes what can fail at each step, and the resolution strategy. For each row, you can also see what is known at the time of failure regarding the *bridging state*. Successful resolution strategy depends on determining the bridging state of the bridge transaction that has failed.

### Notes:

1. With some failures above, as you can see in the Bridging State column, the exact state will not be known at the time of failure or will not have been reported by the UI to the Owner. When the UI restarts and retries calling the ZavaX Agent, the ZavaX Agent must determine the state and proceed accordingly. 

2. As it starts, the UI checks with the ZavaX Agent for previous failures and prompt Owner if there has been one for that Owner's address about how to proceed.

3. The only ZavaX Agent that gets paid fees for its service is the one that completes the bridging transfer. However, any warden-operated ZavaX Agent can push bridging transactions forward.

4. UI = User Interface. ZCE = ZavaX Consensus Engine.

### Fees and Gas

The ZEC.z owner needs enough AVAX in their wallet to pay the gas in connection *14* to call the ZavaX Contract on the C-chain. 

The ZavaX Agent extracts its bridging fee in connection *22* in ZEC:
- Bridging fee goes to ZavaX Agent warden's ZEC address.
- Zcash tx fee goes to Zcash miners.
- Remaining ZEC goes to ZEC.z Owner's t-address.

### Design Choices
You will note that this algorithm puts the ZEC.z in escrow in the smart contract, then tries to unwrap the ZEC, and finally circles back to the smart contract to either burn the ZEC.z in escrow or return it to the ZEC.z Owner depending the success or failure of the ZEC unwrap.

A simpler option would be to burn the ZEC.z, then try to unwrap the ZEC, and only if this fails, circle back to the smart contract and re-mint the ZEC.z.

The reason for this design choice is to minimize the attack surface area for where ZEC.z is minted to one location, as minting is one of the most dangerous activities of the bridge. However, this does make the code more complicated, which increases the overall attack surface. At this point, we are unclear which way is better.
