## ZavaX Zcash-Avalanche Bridge Utilizing an Elastic Subnet
## Architecture

Here you will find architecture-related documents for the ZavaX Zcash-Avalanche bridge. This bridge uses the technique known as *wrapping* to transport value between the Zcash and Avalanche platforms, wrapping Zcash's native token ZEC into ZEC.z which can be used on the Avalanche C-chain and beyond. Likewise, ZEC.z owners can bridge their ZEC.z to ZEC on the Zcash blockchain.

### Key Features
1. This bridge is unique in that it can be operated permissionlessly using an elastic subnet on Avalanche. The subnet's validators serve as bridge wardens, deciding collectively, in a decentralized manner, about what transactions can pass over the bridge and what transactions cannot.

2. A key feature of this bridge is that, as with Ava Lab's Bitcoin-Avalanche bridge, the same private key is used for both the bridge user's Zcash t-address and for the Avalanche C-Chain address. Only the bridge user knows this key; ZavaX components do not need to know it. Because the bridge user knows the private key, they control both wallets exclusively; no ZavaX node or component ever takes possession of their ZEC.z tokens.

3. Another key feature of this bridge is that ZEC locked in the bridge can only be moved by the wardens agreeing to do so *together*. The technology that makes this possible is BLS threshold signatures.

The ZavaX bridge is being built now. These architectural design documents are a step along the way of bringing it to life.

### Audience
In order to understand these architecture at all, you must at least have knowledge of blockchain technology and know the basics about sending and receiving transactions on both Zcash and Avalanche.

Past this, the more you understand about the following topics, the more you'll be able to understand this bridge's architecture:
- Zcash shielded and transparent transactions and addresses
- Zcash wallets such as Ywallet and Nighthawk
- Zcash proof-of-work
- Zcash transactions and fees
- Zebra
- Avalanche C-chain
- Avalanche C-chain transactions and addresses
- Avalanche transactions, fees, and gas
- Avalanche Core Wallet
- Avalanche P-chain
- Avalanche elastic subnets
- AvalancheGo
- Avalanche Snowman++ consensus
- Avalanche warp messaging
- BLS signatures
- UML 2.0
  
These are each briefly described in the **Terms to Know** section, below.
  
### UML

UML is a specification for creating diagrams that convey how software works. We have chosen PlantUML to create these diagrams because it allows us to write instructions about how the elements on each diagram connect with each other, and then the PlantUML rendering engine takes care of the layout. This allows us to focus on content, making revisions easy. Images of all UML diagrams (.png) are provided alongside the PlantUML files (.wsd). You can also learn to view PlantUML diagrams in VSCode by watching [this tutorial](https://youtu.be/xkwJ9GwgZJU?si=OXHAbQdNk-ca63vr) or by visiting [the PlantUML website](https://plantuml.org).

### How to Learn from this Repo

Here is a brief guide about how we recommend you become familiar with ZavaX architecture using this repo. (Most folders also contain a README.md file like this one that describe its contents in more detail.)

1. Begin by watching the short screencast videos in the [BTC.b Bridge Example Screencasts folder](BTC.b%20Bridge%20Example%20Screencasts/) showing how the Bitcoin to Avalanche bridge operated by Ava Labs works from a bridge user's point-of-view. From a user's point-of-view, the ZavaX bridge will work similarly, but instead of transporting BTC to BTC.b and back, it sends ZEC to ZEC.z and back.

2. There are four use cases illustrated in the **ZavaX Use Cases** UML diagram ([PlantUML](UML/Usecase/ZavaX%20Usecases.wsd)/[image](UML/Usecase/ZavaX%20Usecases.png)). For now, focus on the first two. You can then read the [User Stories](User%20Stories/) for these two use cases.

3. Take a look at the two [Deployment UML diagrams](UML/Deployment/) to see how the decentralized bridge is physically configured and connected. Note that the *components* are shown as *rectangles*. These are the actual parts of the bridge that we are building. They work together with the pre-built packages which are shown as *circles*.

4. Look at the **Component UML diagram** ([PlantUML](UML/Component/ZavaX%20Components.wsd)/[image](UML/Component/ZavaX%20Components.png)) to see how the various components of the system interact logically. 

5. Dive deeper! Look at the [User Stories](User%20Stories/) and [UML Sequence diagrams](UML/Sequence/) for the two primary use-cases, **Bridge ZEC Sequence** ([PlantUML](UML/Sequence/Bridge%20ZEC%20Sequence.wsd)/[image](UML/Sequence/Bridge%20ZEC%20Sequence.png)) and **Bridge ZEC.z Sequence** ([PlantUML](UML/Sequence/Bridge%20ZEC.z%20Sequence.wsd)/[image](UML/Sequence/Bridge%20ZEC.z%20Sequence.png)). In the Sequence diagrams, you will see the components and other entities that you already know from the previous diagrams across the top. If you read sequence diagrams from top to bottom, you can follow the software flow between components as the use case is executed. 

* Note that for clarity and simplicity, these diagrams mostly assume success and that all components are functional and communicating well with each other. However, be aware that for each step, we have considered what would happen when, inevitably, there are problems. You can find these documented in table form in an accompanying *notes* documents in the [same folder](UML/Sequence/). (We decided to use this table format instead of creating UML Activity diagrams for each for brevity and clarity.)

* If you would like to look more closely at any part of either UML Sequence diagram, you can look ah the [UML Communication diagrams](UML/Communication/) by the same name. These diagrams each highlight parts of the sequence diagrams, showing the same information but in an expanded and differently arranged format.

6. Look at the **UML Class diagram** ([PlantUML](UML/Class/ZavaX%20Classes.wsd)/[image](UML/Class/ZavaX%20Classes.png)) to see how each of the major components of the system are structured. The class diagram shows a static view of the system architecture that is needed to support the use-cases.

7. Now it's time to learn about how to become a bridge warden by staking the ZavaX bridge's elastic subnet staking token, ZAX. (All elastic subnets require a staking token; this is what allows them to operate permissionlessly.)

* Begin by looking at the **UML Use Case diagram** ([PlantUML](UML/Usecase/ZavaX%20Usecases.wsd)/[image](UML/Usecase/ZavaX%20Usecases.png)) again, but this time focusing on the third and fourth use-cases (which are connected). Then look at the UML Sequence diagrams that you haven't yet examined, **Create ZavaX Validator Sequence** ([PlantUML](UML/Sequence/Create%20ZavaX%20Validator%20Sequence.wsd)/[image](UML/Sequence/Create%20ZavaX%20Validator%20Sequence.png)), **Maintain Wardens Sequence** ([PlantUML](UML/Sequence/Maintain%20Wardens%20Sequence.wsd)/[image](UML/Sequence/Maintain%20Wardens%20Sequence.png)), and [ZavaX **Validator Expires Sequence** ([PlantUML](UML/Sequence/ZavaX%20Validator%20Expires%20Sequence.wsd)/[image](UML/Sequence/ZavaX%20Validator%20Expires%20Sequence.png)). The first and third sequence diagrams should be very familiar to you if you are familiar with how Avalanche validators work. The second, *Maintain Wardens Sequence*, is unique to ZavaX and shows how validators are promoted to wardens and then demoted near the end of their validation period. 
  
* As with the previous use-cases, you can look at the associated *notes* documents [in the same folder](UML/Sequence/) for notes, particularly around failure recovery, and you can zoom in on parts of the UML Sequence diagram by viewing the associated [Communication diagrams](UML/Communication/). Finally, you can look again at the **class diagram** ([PlantUML](UML/Class/ZavaX%20Classes.wsd)/[image](UML/Class/ZavaX%20Classes.png)) to see the structure of the application itself that is needed to support these use cases. 
### Terms to Know

Here are some of the terms that you need to be familiar with to understand the bridge architecture.

**ZEC.z** - *Wrapped Zcash*. ZEC.z is an ERC-20 token on the Avalanche C-Chain that represents ZEC that has passed over the ZavaX bridge from Zcash to Avalanche. It is also compatible with LayerZero bridging protocols.

**ZEC Owner** - The owner of Zcash's currency, ZEC.

**ZEC.z Owner** - The owner of ZEC.z.

**ZavaX Validator** - An Avalanche Primary Network validator that also validates the ZavaX Subnet.

**ZavaX Warden** - A ZavaX Validator that helps to control the ZavaX bridge wallet and bridging transactions.

**[BLS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BLS_digital_signature)** - A well-known threshold digital signature scheme used by Avalanche (and also [Ethereum](https://eth2book.info/capella/part2/building_blocks/signatures/)). 

**ZavaX Bridge UI** - The frontend UI for the ZavaX Bridge, written in HTML and vanilla javascript.

**[Core Wallet](https://core.app/)** - A crypto wallet browser plugin, similar to Metamask in some ways, created by Ava Labs especially for use with Avalanche.

**ZavaX Agent** - A stand-alone golang app that runs on each ZavaX Validator and helps to facilitate bridge operations. Primary duties:
- Deliver warp messages
- Get ZEC balances
- Submit signed ZEC transactions
- Initiate warden maintenance
- Request consensus validation

**Certified ZavaX Agent** - A ZavaX Agent operated by the ZavaX Validator that is currently *certified* by the ZCE to perform the ZavaX Agent job for the *Maintain ZavaX Wardens and Wallet Control* use-case. This use-case runs once every day. As it begins, one ZavaX Agent is certified. Then after five minutes, two more are certified, then at ten minutes, four more are certified, and so on, until the use-case has been completed for that day or all ZavaX Agents have been certified, whichever comes first.

**ZEC.z Contract** - The LayerZero compatible ERC-20 contract on the Avalanche C-Chain that is responsible for ZavaX bridging operations including minting, burning, holding in escrow, sending, and receiving ZEC.z.

**Avalanche Mainnet** - The production Avalanche platform, also known just as *Avalanche*.

**Avalanche Fuji Testnet** - The test environment for Avalanche that runs the same node software as the Avalanche Mainnet but uses test-AVAX as its primary token which has no value.

**Avalanche Primary Network** - The main Avalanche subnet that contains the P-Chain, the C-Chain, and the X-Chain. (Note: Both the Avalanche Mainnet and the Avalanche Fuji Testnet have their own Avalanche primary network.)

**C-Chain** The Avalanche primary network's C-Chain which is based on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).

**P-Chain** The Avalanche primary network's P-Chain which is responsible for adding and removing validators from the primary network and subnets and for storing BLS keys that ZavaX uses for warp messaging.

**Avalanche X-Chain** - A chain used mostly for sending AVAX quickly and cheaply, and it is also where the ZavaX elastic subnet staking token ZAX is created. 

**AvalancheGo** - Avalanche node software maintained by Ava Labs.

**[Zebra](https://zfnd.org/zebra/)** - Zcash node software maintained by the Zcash Foundation.

**[Ywallet](https://ywallet.app/)** and **[Nighthawk Wallet](https://nighthawkwallet.com/)** - Wallet software that can be used with Zcash shielded and transparent  pools. (Other wallets exist as well.)

**ZavaX Consensus Engine (ZCE)** - The heart of the ZavaX bridge subnet, this code is what allows all the nodes to reach consensus on accepting or rejecting each step required to bridge between Zcash and Avalanche and to perform other bridge-related functionality. All of the decision-making for the bridge happens in this code. No other components have any decision-making power.

**Warp Message** - This is a standard message format that Avalanche supports for communication between subnets.

**Gas** - This is the charge, in AVAX, of running code on the C-Chain, and specifically the ZavaX contract.

**Tx Fee** - This is the charge, in ZEC, of processing a transaction on the Zcash blockchain.

**Bridging Fee** - This is a charge, in either ZEC or ZEC.z, that the bridge nodes charge for processing bridging transactions in addition to the Gas and Tx Fees.

**ZavaX Elastic Subnet** - This is a group of Avalanche primary network validators that also have installed the ZavaX components necessary to help run the ZavaX bridge, and on which their owners have staked at least 2000 ZAX. "Elastic" refers to the fact that the validators are allowed to validate the subnet just by staking ZAX rather than by being on a permissioned list.

**ZAX token** - The ZavaX-specific Avalanche token, created on the X-Chain, that is used for staking the ZavaX Elastic Subnet.
